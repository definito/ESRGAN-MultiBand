# ESRGAN-MultiBand
ESRGAN-MultiBand is a PyTorchLightning-based implementation of the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) adapted for multispectral satellite imagery. Unlike typical RGB applications, this version supports 4+ spectral bands (e.g., near-infrared, red-edge) commonly found in remote sensing datasets.
